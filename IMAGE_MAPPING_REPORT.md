## Mapping Strategy

### Priority Order:
1. **Game-specific image** (e.g., `{game-id}.webp`)
2. **WG.com original image** (based on `imageMetadata.id`)
3. **Category fallback image**

### Examples:

#### ✅ Game-Specific Image
```json
{
  "id": "dragon-treasure",
  "images": {
    "local_main": "/assets/images/games/dragon-treasure.webp",
    "local_icon": "/assets/images/games/wg_game_5010_zh_icon.webp"
  }
}
```

#### ✅ WG.com Original Image
```json

  "id": "magic-6",
  "images": {
    "local_main": "/assets/images/games/wg_game_2001_zh.webp",
    "local_icon": "/assets/images/games/wg_game_2001_zh_icon.webp"
  }
}
```

#### ⚠️ Fallback Image
```json
{
  "id": "mini baccarat-16",
  "images": {
    "local_main": "/assets/images/games/american-18.webp",
    "local_icon": "/assets/images/games/american-18.webp"
  }
}
